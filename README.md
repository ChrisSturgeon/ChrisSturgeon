### Hi there! My name is Chris Sturgeon ðŸ‘‹

A little bit about me: 

- Recently completed The Odin Project and developed a passion for front-end programming along the way.
- Currently working on Session Hub, a blog and social media app for watersports.
- Blogging over at [chrissturgeon.co.uk](https://www.chrissturgeon.co.uk).
- Aside from programming I love to get outdoors, either windsurfing on the coast or trail running in the countryside.
